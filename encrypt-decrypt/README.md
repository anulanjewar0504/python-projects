## Description

This repository contains the source code for a simple message encryptor and decryptor tool created using Python's Tkinter library. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a password and Base64 encoding.

**Features:**

* Encrypt and decrypt text messages using a password.
* User-friendly interface with separate windows for encryption and decryption.
* Clear instructions and error messages for user guidance.
* Option to reset text and password fields.

**Limitations:**

* Uses a hardcoded password for encryption, making it less secure for sensitive information.
* Employs Base64 encoding, which is not a robust encryption method.
* Lacks features like file encryption, advanced algorithms, or key management.

**Getting Started:**

1. Install the required libraries: `pip install tkinter`
2. Run the main script: `python main_screen.py`

**Note:** This is a basic example and not intended for serious security applications. Consider exploring more secure encryption methods and libraries for sensitive information.
